                <p>I am Aliyah G. Masangcay, 18 years old and I am from the town of Mariveles. I love to cook and eat. I dream of travelling to many countries and one of those is South Korea, and maybe after travelling the world, I would like to settle down in Switzerland. If asked what my favorite food is, I would mention many foods but if asked what I would always order when eating out, I would definitely say sinigang—any type of sinigang—if it’s available. If there are no sinigang, then I would definitely choose any pasta dishes.</p>
                <p>I am a first year student of Bataan Peninsula State University - Main Campus taking up the program Bachelor of Science in Information Technology major in Network and Web Application. This program is actually my 3rd choice. However, my family thought otherwise. My first choice was actually Medical Technology because since I was a kid, I have dreamt of being someone in the medical field or maybe a chef, specifically a doctor. But, due to practicality, I decided to take this program.</p>
                <p>To be genuinely honest, I never really saw myself in this field. I have always dreamed of being someone who is in the medical field—maybe a doctor or a medical technologist— or an aspiring chef. However, due to some circumstances, I have chosen this field to pursue. I saw it as something more “practical” than my dreams. Although I enjoy the program, there are always these what if’s on the back of my head that would randomly pop up. But I guess we’ll never get to answer those questions in this lifetime.</p>
                <p>I love to cook. As early as maybe 5 or 6 years old, my parents would include me in the kitchen whenever they are available to cook. Consequently, I started to love cooking and would try out new recipes here and there. I have always seen cooking as something that me and my parents could bond over that is why I strived to learn more about it. If I am not in the Information Technology field, maybe I’d be in culinary or maybe in medicine.</p>
                <p>To conclude this introduction, I am Aliyah Masangcay, a girl who would always choose to be practical and someone who is independent but would not mind having someone to depend on. I have realized many things as I grow up and I think that is what makes life beautiful—you get to learn about yourself. Exploring about oneself, for me, is a great privilege for an individual. It gets us to know ourselves more and develop certain characteristics. And for me, that is something that helps one grow.</p>
