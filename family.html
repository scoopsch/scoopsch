            <h1 class="intro">This is my family!</h1>
            <p class="intro" style="padding-top: 3px; padding-bottom: 5px;">As someone who is an only child, I really consider each and everyone in my family as someone who is important so it is kind of hard to choose just 5 people as my family has 13 people–including me. That is why I have decided to put all of them here—my parents, grandmother, and the family of my father's two younger brothers. I consider all of them important as they all contributed to who I am and how I developed as an individual.

                <p>This is my mother. Her name is <b>Margie G. Masangcay</b>. For me, my mother is someone who I really look up to. She is someone who I have always seen as strong and at the same time a soft person. She balances being firm when needed and showing kindness when it matters most.</p>
                <p>My mother has always been a source of inspiration and support in my life. She works hard to provide for our family, making sure we have everything we need. Despite her responsibilities, she always finds time to care for us and show her love. Her patience and understanding make her someone I can always turn to to talk things about. She teaches me valuable lessons about life, responsibility, and perseverance.</p>
                <p>Beyond being a great mother, she is also a wonderful person to everyone around her. She treats people with respect and kindness, always willing to lend a helping hand. Her generosity and selflessness inspire me to be a better person. She has taught me the importance of hard work and never giving up. I am truly grateful to have her as my mother, and I hope to make her proud in everything I do.</p>

                <p>This is my father. He’s <b>Bien A. Masangcay</b>. If I was asked when I was a kid to describe who my father is, I would tell them that my father is the most fearsome man that I know. Before doing things, I would always consider whether my father would get angry before doing it. But as I grew up, I have realized that how my father would react is just his way of expressing his love–by not pampering me when I did something wrong.</p>
                <p>As I matured, I started to understand the depth of my father’s love and the lessons he wanted to teach me. He has always been a man of discipline, instilling in me the values of responsibility and respect. He always expresses his emotions through words and his actions speak volumes–I guess, he is the perfect example of words partnered with actions.. He works hard to provide for our family and makes sacrifices to ensure we have a good life. I now appreciate that his strictness was never about control but about shaping me into a better person.</p>
                <p>Beyond his discipline, my father is also a man with a kind heart. He cares deeply for our family and always looks out for our well-being. He may not always show affection in the usual ways, but his love is evident in everything he does. His strength and guidance have played a huge role in making me who I am today. I am truly grateful for my father, and I will always carry his lessons with me as I move forward in life.</p>

                <p>This is my lola. Her name is <b>Clarita A. Masangcay</b>. I remember when I was a kid, lola would always take my side whenever something was wrong or when I was getting scolded. She would defend me and comfort me, making sure I felt safe and loved. Her presence has always been a source of warmth and security in my life.</p>
                <p>Aside from being protective, my lola is also one of the most caring and selfless people I know. She always makes sure that everyone in the family is well-fed and taken care of. Her love is shown in the little things, like cooking my favorite meals or telling me stories from her past. Even when she is tired, she never fails to put others before herself. Her kindness and generosity are things I truly admire and hope to carry on.</p>
                <p>Beyond her love for our family, my lola is also a strong and wise woman. She has taught me valuable lessons about life, patience, and resilience. No matter what challenges she faces, she remains optimistic and full of love. Her strength inspires me to be a better person and to always treat others with kindness. I am truly grateful to have her in my life, and I cherish every moment I spend with her.</p>
