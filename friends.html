            <p class="intro" style="padding-top: 3px; padding-bottom: 5px;">I have a small number of friends—a total of 14 people—whom I consider is the most important ones and I think it's kind of unfair if I just put 5 people here since all of them are great companion through the highest and lowest points of my life. So yes, just like what I did in my family tab, I have decided to put all of them since all of them are important.</p>

                <h4 class="title">Fuds</h4>
                <p>This is my circle of friends from junior highschool up to now. These people have made great contributions to how I developed as a person. They have made my highschool life easier by just being there and by always having an open arms whenever I need comfort. They have witnessed almost everything—from me having my first boyfriend, first breakup, the times when I failed and won, everything. If there are people whom I can tell others that know me well, they’d be those.</p>
                <p>Beyond just being my friends, they have become my second family. We have shared countless memories together, from simple lunch breaks to unforgettable gala and celebrations. No matter how busy life gets, we always find time to check on each other and make sure no one feels left behind. They have taught me the value of true friendship, which goes beyond just having fun—it’s about support, trust, and understanding. Through the years, they have proven that real friendships withstand both distance and time.</p>
                <p>Even now, as we grow older and take different paths, our bond remains unbreakable. We may not always see each other every day, but we know we are just one call away when needed. They continue to inspire me to be the best version of myself, reminding me that I am never alone. I am truly grateful for their presence in my life, and I hope our friendship lasts a lifetime. No matter where life takes us, I know we will always have each other’s backs.</p>

                <h4 class="title">Star ng Pasko</h4>
                <p>This is my most unexpected circle of friends. I met them during the first day of college. I once thought that I would have trouble making friends during college since I am not an extrovert person and talking to people whom I do not know kind of gives me chills. But with them, it was different. Maybe it was their welcoming demeanor that made me comfortable while making a connection with them.</p>
                <p>As time passed, our bond grew stronger, and I found myself becoming more open with them. They made college life easier by being my support system during stressful times, whether it was handling difficult subjects or adjusting to new experiences. With them, I never felt alone because they were always there to share both struggles and laughter. Their kindness and understanding helped me gain more confidence in myself. Through them, I learned that friendship sometimes comes when you least expect it.</p>
                <p>Now, I can't imagine my college journey without them. Even with our busy schedules, we always find time to catch up, whether through simple conversations or spontaneous hangouts. They have taught me that genuine friendships are not about how long you've known each other but about the connection and trust you build over time. I am grateful to have met them, as they have made my college life more meaningful. No matter where life takes us, I know our friendship will always remain strong.</p>

                <h4 class="title">Geline</h4>
                <p>This one is Geline. She’s someone whom I met when we were in our first year of senior high school. We bonded over our love for k-pop and eventually became friends. At first, I never really saw myself being friends with her because she seems intimidating. However, when I got to know her, she is one of the sweetest people one could ever meet.</p>
                <p>As our friendship grew, I saw how thoughtful and caring she truly is. She always made an effort to check up on me, especially during difficult times. Whether it was through simple messages or surprise snacks, she always found ways to show she cared. Her sense of humor and positive energy never failed to lift my mood. Being around her made my senior high school journey more fun and memorable.</p>
                <p>Even now, our bond remains strong despite the changes in our lives. We may not always see each other as often, but we make sure to stay connected. She has become one of the few people I can always count on, no matter the situation. I am truly grateful for her friendship and the countless memories we have shared. No matter where life takes us, I know she will always be someone I cherish.</p>

                <h4 class="title">Nixon</h4>
                <p>This one is Nixon. She has been my friend since junior high school, specifically, when the pandemic started. We bonded over K-pop, K-drama, and helped each other in terms of academics during online classes. Despite the challenges of virtual learning, our friendship grew stronger as we navigated those times together. She became one of the people I could rely on, whether it was for schoolwork or simply to share my thoughts and feelings.</p>
                <p>When we were in senior high school, she transferred to another country to continue her studies. It was difficult at first, knowing that we could no longer see each other in person. However, we made sure to keep in touch. Even though we are in different time zones, we still find ways to support and comfort one another. Our friendship proved that distance doesn’t have to be a barrier when both people genuinely care.</p>
                <p>And although we are kilometers apart, social media has helped us to stay connected. We still talk about our favorite K-dramas, recommend new songs, and reminisce about the memories we shared. Whenever we catch up, it feels like nothing has changed, as if we were still just a message away. I truly appreciate our friendship and how we continue to make the effort to stay close. No matter where life takes us, I know she will always be a special part of my life.</p>

                <h4 class="title">Aemon</h4>
                <p>The one here is Aemon. He’s someone who is really full of energy. An embodiment of extrovert I must say. He’s always socializing with people. Everywhere he went, he would always wave his hand at people whom he may know.</p>
                <p>Beyond his outgoing personality, Aemon is also someone who brings positivity to those around him. He has a way of making people feel comfortable and included, no matter the situation. His humor and enthusiasm can easily brighten up even the dullest moments. He’s the type of friend who never runs out of stories to tell, making every conversation interesting. Being around him makes life a little more exciting and fun.</p>
                <p>Despite his playful nature, Aemon is also a dependable friend. He knows when to be serious and offers support when needed. No matter how busy he is, he always finds time to check in on his friends. His energy isn’t just about being loud or outgoing—it’s also about bringing warmth and genuine care to those he values. I’m grateful to have him as a friend, as he reminds me to enjoy life and cherish the people around me.</p>
